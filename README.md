👋 Hi, I’m Fiona!

With over 15 years of experience in the tech industry, I have a strong grasp of the entire product development lifecycle. My skills lie in software engineering (primarily backend), technical leadership, product management and strategic delivery. I thrive in high-performing teams and delivering solutions that drive real impact.

- 👀 I’m interested in continuously learning and empowering others through mentorship and collaboration.
- 🛠️ I’m currently learning modern backend technologies and refreshing my .NET skills.
- 🌱 Beyond Github, I’m creating a roadmap of CRO experiments and I'm volunteering with a charity to maintain their Wordpress website.
